// IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ALL THE QUESTIONS AT ONCE:
// HINT: for each question, create a container with the "question"
// create a radio button https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio with, as option the both the correct answer and the incorrect answers
// when EVERY question has an answer (google for how to get a value from a radio button with JS)
// IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ONE QUESTION AT A TIME
// Display first question with a title + radio button
// when the user select the answer, pick the next question and remove this from the page after added in a varible the users' choice.

// HOW TO calculate the result
// You can do it in 2 ways:
// If you are presenting all questions together, just take all the radio buttons and check if the selected answer === correct_answer
// If you are presenting one question at a time, just add one point or not to the user score if the selected answer === correct_answer
